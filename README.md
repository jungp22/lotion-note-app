# Lotion
Note App using the React framework.

## Stuff I practiced
- Used 3 external libraries:
    - `react-router-dom` for front-end routing
    - `react-quill` for the text editor
    - `uuid` for generating universally unique identifiers for the keys
- Implemented persistent storage using `localStorage`
- Familiarized myself with the following React hooks:
    - useState
    - useEffect

## Future Steps
- Explore more with React hooks
- Layout route would make it reload less
- Searchable Tags
- Searching and sorting option
